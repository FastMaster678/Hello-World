Welcome to my Hello World repository!
Some people use Hello World as a simple sentence to test code.
But my goal is to make that test line on multiple platforms!
SO FAR: Regular GitHub repo text | Windows Phone 8/8.1/10 Mobile (C#) | Windows Phone 7 (C#) |
COMING SOON: Hello World as Windows application *Coming late January 2023!* | Hello World as Android application *Coming mid-February 2023!* |


Come back soon for more Hello World goodness!
