Welcome to my Hello World repository!
Some people use Hello World as a simple sentence to test code.
But my goal is to make that test line on multiple platforms!
SO FAR: Regular GitHub repo text | Windows Phone 8/8.1/10 Mobile (C#) | Windows Phone 7 (C#) | Windows (Terminal, C#)
COMING SOON: Hello World as Android application *Coming early-March 2023!* | Hello World for macOS *TBA*


Come back soon for more Hello World goodness!
